Angel CMS Workbench

This is a default Laravel 4.1 installation that loads the Angel CMS packages as [GIT submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules) in the [Laravel Workbench](http://laravel.com/docs/packages#creating-a-package).

This repository is only needed if you intend to develop the Angel core or any modules for it.
